# INTRODUCTION
This task focuses on creating a detailed visualization of medical students' records from the provided dataset using Pivot tables and their functions on an Excel spreadsheet.

# ACTIVITY
A dataset of students' medical records was used to generate pivot tables from the activity below and to show the insights gathered from the pivot tables developed.

1. The average values of males and females age, BMI, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol
2. The average height and weight for both genders, in two (2) decimal places
3. The total number of students across the different blood groups
4. The total number of students who smoke and those who do not smoke
5. The total number of students who have diabetes and those without diabetes

# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
1. Data Cleaning
2. Creating Pivot Tables
3. Data Visualization using pivot charts from pivot tables

# DATA CLEANING
The raw dataset contained 13 columns of information, which included the Student ID, their age, and some health metrics. The rows contained 200,000 pieces of information corresponding to the respective columns as well as some blank spaces.

The dataset was cleaned by filling up the blank spaces with the average values of each column. For the columns that contained gender, blood group, smoking, and diabetes, they were calculated by using COUNTIF to find out the highest occurring value, which was used to fill up the blank spaces in these columns. After that, I transformed the full data set into a table by highlighting the entire data set, pressing Control T, and adjusting the header to fit into the column accordingly.
